# Dispensive Cauldrons
This fabric mod allows interactions between dispensers and cauldrons.\
Functionality included:
- Dispensers with empty buckets will pick up lava/water/powder snow from a cauldron if the cauldron is full of that resource.
- When a bucket of lava/water/powder snow is selected to be dispensed, if facing into an empty cauldron or one of the same resource type, it will fill the cauldron.
- Similar functionality with glass bottles and water bottles, but will only increase/decrease the water level by 1.
